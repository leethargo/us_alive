us_alive - an international keyboard layout without dead keys
=============================================================

This layout extends the basic US English layout with a few additional
letters for usage in international texts.

US English was used as the base because of convenient access to
punctuation and stuff for programming. Dead keys are avoided, to keep
compatibility to the base layout.

At the moment, only German language is supported, i.e., the letters
    ä Ä ö Ö ü Ü ß €
are made available.


The file 'us_alive' should be copied to, e.g.,
    /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols
and can be activated from the shell with
    $ setxkbmap us_alive
